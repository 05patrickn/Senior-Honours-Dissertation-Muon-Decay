# Senior Honours Project: Muon Decay Analysis

This repository contains all the components for the Project on Muon Decay, including raw data, Python code, and figures used in the report and poster. The Python folders are organized by their corresponding experiments. Please be aware that certain code segments may need adjustments to the raw data directories for seamless execution.

## Repository Structure:

1. **Counts Raw Data:**
   - Raw data collected for the experiments is stored in this directory.

2. **Python Files:**
   - The Python code for each experiment is organized into separate folders. Adjust the file paths as needed to match your local directory structure.

3. **Diagram:**
   - This directory contains figures generated during the data analysis. These figures are referenced in both the report and poster.

5. **Preassure and Flare Data**
   - This folder contains additional raw data, notable the pressure and flare event data that was used during processing.
## Running the Code:

Before executing the Python code, ensure that the directory paths pointing to the raw data are correctly specified. Update these paths in the code as necessary.

### Example Code Structure:

```python
# Update these paths according to your local directory structure
data_path_experiment_1 = "/path/to/experiment_1/data/"
data_path_experiment_2 = "/path/to/experiment_2/data/"
```
